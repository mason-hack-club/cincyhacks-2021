# CincyHacks Code Of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Hack Club Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/).

TL;DR of the Code of Conduct:

    Treat everyone with respect and kindness.
    Be thoughtful in how you communicate.
    Don't be destructive or inflammatory.
    If you encounter an issue, please contact a staff member.

## Hacker Values

These are the values to which people attending the CincyHacks event should aspire.

    Be friendly and welcoming
    Be patient
        Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).
    Be thoughtful
        Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
        Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
    Be respectful
        In particular, respect differences of opinion.
    Be charitable
        Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
        When we do disagree, try to understand why.
    Avoid destructive behavior:
        Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
        Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
        Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
        Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
        Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

These actions are explicitly forbidden at CincyHacks:

    Expressing or provoking:
        insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks;
        discrimination based on age, nationality, race, (dis)ability, gender (identity or expression), sexuality, religion, or similar personal characteristic;
        bullying or systematic harassment;
        unwelcome sexual advances, including sexually explicit content.
    Excessive advertisement for unnecessary or non-beneficial commercial products and services.
    Posting spam-like content that disrupts the environment of the community.
    Using expletives/"swear words" in public channels.
